//KonsKernel

KonsKernel is a personal learning project focused on building a custom operating system kernel.

This project is primarily educational and experimental.  
I am learning low-level systems programming by actually building a kernel, which means the codebase may change frequently and is not always clean or stable.

//Notes
- Some parts of the code were refactored with the help of AI tools, mainly for debugging and stability.
- There may be outdated comments and experimental implementations.
- Bugs and unexpected behavior are expected at this stage.

//Feedback
If you encounter bugs or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or contact me.

You can call me Kons (or Stan — either is fine).

This project is about learning, not perfection.
